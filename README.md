# 🛒 E-Commerce Transaction Purchasing Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of **product categories** and **payment methods** on **purchase amounts** in e-commerce transactions.  
Using statistical analysis and machine learning models, I try to explore key factors influencing purchasing behavior.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
### **Programming & Libraries**
- **Python:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data manipulation and analysis
  - `seaborn`, `matplotlib` – Data visualization
  - `scipy.stats`, `statsmodels.api` – Statistical analysis
  - `sklearn.model_selection` – Train-test splitting
  - `sklearn.ensemble`, `sklearn.metrics` – Machine learning models & evaluation
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visualizations

## 🔍 Predictive Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression** – Classifies purchase amounts into high or low categories
- **Linear Regression** – Predicts the exact purchase amount
- **Random Forest** – Improves prediction accuracy and handles non-linearity

## 📊 Overview of the Dataset

🔗 **Link to the dataset:** [E-Commerce Transactions Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smayanj/e-commerce-transactions-dataset?resource=download)

This dataset consists of **50,000 fictional e-commerce transaction records**, making it ideal for **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning experiments**. It contains information about **user demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, payment methods, and transaction dates**, allowing us to explore consumer behavior and sales trends.

### 📂 Dataset Columns:

| Column Name         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Transaction_ID**  | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| **User_Name**       | Randomly generated user name |
| **Age**            | Age of the user (range: **18 to 70**) |
| **Country**        | Country where the transaction took place (**randomly chosen from 10 countries**) |
| **Product_Category** | Category of the purchased item (**e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books**) |
| **Purchase_Amount** | Total amount spent on the transaction (**randomly generated between $5 and $1000**) |
| **Payment_Method**  | Method used for payment (**e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, UPI**) |
| **Transaction_Date** | Date of the purchase (**randomly selected within the past two years**) |

## 🚀 Next Steps: Project Implementation
We will now proceed with **data analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling** using various machine learning techniques.
